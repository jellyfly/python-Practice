# explanation for what I will do
print "I will now count my chickens:"

# calculate the sum of 25 + 5, / has more previledge than +
print "Hens", 25.0 + 30.0 / 6.0
# calculate the result of 100-75 % 4 = 100 - 3
print "Roosters", 100.0 - 25.0 * 3.0 % 4.0

# explanation of what will be done next
print "Now I will count the eggs:"

#  calculate 1  - 1/4 + 6 = 7 (more than 0.5 = 1, less  = 0)
print 3.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 - 5.0 + 4.0 % 2.0 - 1.0 / 4.0 + 6.0

# given a question
print "Is it true that 3.0 + 2.0 < 5.0 - 7.0?"

# give the solution
print 3.0 + 2.0 < 5.0 - 7.0

#explanation of the above answer
print "What is 3.0 + 2.0?", 3.0 + 2.0
print "What is 5.0 - 7.0?", 5.0 - 7.0
print "Oh, that's why it's False."

print " How about some more."

print "Is it greater?", 5.0 > -2.0
print "Is it greatrer or equal?", 5.0 >= -2.0
print "Is it less or equal?", 5.0 <= -2.0
