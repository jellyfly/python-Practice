# explanation for what I will do
print "I will now count my chickens:"

# calculate the sum of 25 + 5, / has more previledge than +
print "Hens", 25 + 30 / 6
# calculate the result of 100-75 % 4 = 100 - 3
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

# explanation of what will be done next
print "Now I will count the eggs:"

#  calculate 1  - 1/4 + 6 = 7 (more than 0.5 = 1, less  = 0)
print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

# given a question
print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

# give the solution
print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

#explanation of the above answer
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2
print "What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7
print "Oh, that's why it's False."

print " How about some more."

print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2
print "Is it greatrer or equal?", 5 >= -2
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2
